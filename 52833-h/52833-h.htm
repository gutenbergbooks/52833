<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most interesting and vivid of our
recollections is that of witnessing some scenes in
negro slavery in the United States, now upwards
of twenty years ago&mdash;very nearly the close of the
iniquity; but of that nobody was aware. There was
a novelty in seeing fairly dressed men and women
brought out for sale by public auction, and in
observing how the persons who came to buy carefully
examined the men's hands and the flexibility
of their fingers, looked into their mouths to make
sure of their teeth, and having effected a removal
of the coats and shirts, scanned the bare backs to
discover whether they had suffered by the lash.
Just as in buying horses in a market, it was quite
a business affair; and what was a little surprising,
the unfortunate objects of this degrading exhibition
took all in good part. But what else could they
do? In the grasp of power, they knew that resistance
was worse than useless. Close by were cow-hide
whips handled by heartless ruffians voraciously
chewing tobacco, as if to keep up the proper
inspiration of brutality. Across the way was seen
an ugly brick building inscribed with the word
<span class="smcap">Jail</span>, in tall black letters on a white ground, to
which establishment, in case of remonstrance, the
poor wretches would have been instantly marched
for punishment. Doom hopeless!</p>

<p>The equanimity, and indeed the good-humour,
with which these blacks seemed to endure their
fate, indicated, we thought, good points of character.
Nowhere in travelling about did we observe
anything positively disagreeable, to remind us
that the labourers in the fields or the loiterers at
doorways were slaves. Often, we heard singing
and jollity, as if light-heartedness was on the whole
predominant. Obviously, slave-owners were not all
Legrees. On the contrary, in many instances they
shewed a kind indulgence to their &#8216;servants,&#8217; as
they called them, and were pleased to see them
singing, laughing, and making merry in the intervals
of rest from labour. Perhaps this is not
saying much, for the singing of slaves may be
compared to the notes of a bird in captivity, to
be admired, but pitied. Anyway, there was a
disposition to seek solacement in the outpouring
of song. If not intellectually brilliant, the negro
is naturally vivacious. Even when he grows
old, he is still something of a boy, with an
inherent love of frolic. He is clever in picking
up tunes, and one of the complaints which we
heard against him in a free state was that if not
looked after by his master, he would continually
go out to entertainments and dance all night.
A curious result of the taste for music has been
the creation of what are known as negro melodies;
partly suggested by old English airs, and by the
psalm and hymn tunes that had been heard at
church or in the devotional exercises of missionaries.
With a blended simplicity and oddity, the
negro airs which have gained currency are wonderfully
harmonious and touching. The time is well
marked, shewing correctness of ear, and accordingly
the pieces, however eccentric in language, are well
adapted for singing in harmony by a number of
voices. From the performances of the &#8216;Christy
Minstrels,&#8217; as they are usually designated&mdash;white
men with blackened faces imitative of negroes&mdash;people
will have a pretty good idea of the
melodies we speak of; but we should say that
the real thing is to be obtained only from a band
of genuine negroes, who for some years have
been travelling about, and who style themselves
the Jubilee Singers. Of these we want to say
something.</p>

<p>As is well known, the abolition of slavery in the
United States was no deliberate act of national
justice and humanity, but took place in consequence
of a proclamation issued by President
Lincoln in the exigency of the civil war in 1862.
Without preparation for freedom, over four millions
of slaves were thrown on their own resources.
They could work, but comparatively few of them
could read; for it had been hitherto penal to
teach them. Considering their state of ignorance,
and the good grounds they generally had for
resenting past treatment, they behaved with a
singular degree of moderation. What, however,
was to be done with such a mass of illiterates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
unaccustomed to self-reliance, and who, even if
desirous of being taught, had no means of being
so? Here comes in a bright feature of the
Anglo-Saxon and Christian-minded North. Within
six months of the close of the war, societies of
benevolent individuals sprang up to extend the
blessings of elementary education to hordes of
negroes; and in which movement ladies appropriately
took part. In the confusion and rankling
animosities that prevailed in the South, the efforts
to uplift the negro by means of schools were
heroic, often dangerous, and always attended with
difficulty. There was likewise much good done
by the American Missionary Association. Schools,
academies, and preaching stations were at length
established in quarters where they were most
needed. To complete the organisation of humanising
influences, some thoughtful individuals
struck out the idea of establishing a University
for the higher education of the freed people, and
training them to go forth as ministers and
teachers, as well as leaders in various departments
of civil life.</p>

<p>It was easier to conceive this brilliant idea than
to bring it to a practical issue. Where was the
money to come from to build a University, to
equip it properly, and to pay for professors?
There would even be a difficulty in finding a site,
for few land-owners in a central situation would
be willing to promote the elevation of the coloured
races. The history of the way in which these
preliminary difficulties were overcome is about as
interesting a narrative as we ever read. Immense
spirit and ingenuity were developed in bringing
the scheme into shape. Without saying what it
was for, a suitable site was procured at the price
of sixteen thousand dollars, near Nashville, the
capital of Tennessee. There were already a few
frame-buildings on the spot, which were employed
to accommodate a school, as a beginning of the
proposed educational operations. The institution
was called the Fisk University, in honour of
General Clinton B. Fisk, who had taken a warm
interest in the undertaking. The establishment
was opened in January 1866.</p>

<p>By-and-by the school, or we might say schools,
throve. Thousands of negroes were taught by
a band of eager teachers, some of whom only a
short time before did not know one letter from
another. There was an honest enthusiasm in
the whole affair that brought with it the blessing
of success. Again we are called on to note what
good is often done by the quiet unprompted and
unselfish energy of a single individual. About
the time when the Fisk University was organised,
there cast up a young man named White,
who, looking about for a means of livelihood,
took up the profession of teacher. He was the
son of a village blacksmith in the state of New
York, had fought in several battles during the
war, and made himself useful in connection with
the Freedman's Bureau at Nashville. He had a
special taste for vocal music, with which he
amused his leisure hours, and this accomplishment
along with good business habits, made him very
acceptable as a coadjutor in the University. White
started a singing class among the negroes, male
and female, who came to get lessons in reading;
and, pleased with their aptitude, he fell upon
the bold plan of drilling them as a choir of singers,
who should travel through the Northern cities
in the hope of gathering money to help the University
funds. Getting his band into trim, he
set out with them on a musical excursion in
October 1871, carrying with them the good wishes
of all, from the Principal of the institution downwards.</p>

<p>In our own country, the getting up of a university,
or even the enlargement of one, is ordinarily
a serious affair. Unless some wealthy person has
bequeathed money for the purpose, government is
worried for grants, and the public are worried for
subscriptions. Keeping proceedings of this kind
in view, one can hardly fail to be amused with the
novel and heroic notion entertained by a dozen
simple-minded negroes in trying to collect fifty
to a hundred thousand pounds for a University by
mere dint of singing a few simple hymns, which
illustrious dons of the musical profession would
only laugh at. Yet, this is what was attempted.
Led by White as general manager, and by Miss
Wells, who took the oversight of the girls of the
party, the negroes went on their way, poorly
clothed, and with barely means to pay for a night's
lodging. We observe by the history given of
them, that they trusted a good deal to kind treatment
from Congregational and other churches.
They got the gratuitous use of chapels for their
concerts, or what were termed &#8216;praise services,&#8217;
and when they became known, engagements
freely poured in upon them. The sweetness
of the voices, the accuracy of the execution, the
precision of the time, and the wild simplicity of
the words, astonished the audiences who listened to
them; the wonder being of course augmented by
the fact of their colour and the knowledge that only
a few years ago these singers had been slaves. Although
generally well received, they had at first
numerous difficulties to encounter. The expense
of travelling from town to town was considerable.
To give a distinctive character to their enterprise,
they assumed the name of Jubilee Singers, significant
of their emancipation in 1862, as the year of
negro jubilee!</p>

<p>Their first eminent successes were at New York,
Boston, and in Connecticut. The good-will of the
people took the shape not only of money contributions,
but of articles to furnish their proposed
University. A firm at Boston made them a present
of a thousand dollar organ. The singing campaign
of three months over the principal parts of the
Northern states yielded, after paying all expenses,
the sum of twenty thousand dollars. The company
were received at the University with joy and
thanksgiving&mdash;a prodigious triumph for White, the
planner and conductor of the expedition.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, a second campaign
followed, and the result was another sum of twenty
thousand dollars, making forty thousand that had
now been secured. In this expedition, the party
encountered various caste prejudices. Halls were
refused to them; at some railway stations they
were treated with indignity, and hotel-keepers
declined to give them accommodation. At one
hotel where the keeper received them, all the
waiters deserted their posts, and the Jubilee
Singers waited on themselves and blackened their
own boots. These misadventures were taken with
good-humour. Having so far done well within
American territory, the party resolved to try their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
fortune in Great Britain, for which purpose they
were favoured with letters of introduction likely
to advance their enterprise. Curiously enough,
cabin accommodation was refused to the party by
one after another of the leading ocean steamship
lines. At last they were received on board one of
the Cunard steamers, and safely and agreeably
landed in England.</p>

<p>The letters of introduction worked marvels.
We are to contemplate the Jubilee Singers one
May afternoon in 1873, at Willis's Rooms, giving
a private concert to a select body of individuals,
by invitation of the Earl of Shaftesbury and a
Committee of the Freedman's Aid Society. There
was a distinguished assemblage; the singers did
their best, and all were delighted. The Duke
and Duchess of Argyll were foremost in expressing
a desire to promote the object of the party, and
arranged for a visit of the singers to Argyll Lodge
the next day. This visit to Argyll Lodge was
a notable event. The Queen, who is always
foremost in works of intelligent benevolence,
graciously attended for a short time, and listened
with manifest pleasure to the hymns which the
singers had learned in bondage. Her Majesty
in departing, communicated through the Duke
her thanks for the gratification she had received.
These preliminary efforts insured to the Jubilee
Singers a wide round of popularity. Hospitable
invitations poured in upon them from persons
of literary and political distinction. Among the
most pleasurable of these invitations was one to
breakfast from Mr Gladstone, then prime-minister,
by whom they were cordially received. After
breakfast, the singers entertained the company
with their wonderful music. The intense feeling
with which they sang <i>John Brown</i>, with the
refrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">John Brown died that the slave might be free,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>electrified the audience; and &#8216;never,&#8217; said a
spectator, &#8217;shall I forget Mr Gladstone's rapt
enthusiastic attention. His form was bent forward,
his eyes were riveted; all the intellect and soul
of his great nature seemed expressed in his countenance;
and when they had finished, he kept
saying: &#8220;Isn't it wonderful? I never heard anything
like it!&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>After spending three months in London, the
Jubilee Singers proceeded to give a round of
concerts in the principal towns of England and
Scotland; being everywhere well received by large
and appreciative audiences. Financially, the excursion
was eminently successful. Nearly ten
thousand pounds had been raised for the Fisk
University, besides special gifts for the purchase
of philosophical apparatus, and donations of books
for the library. The money collected first and
last by the singers now amounted to about twenty
thousand pounds, which went a considerable way
towards the building of the University, which
assumed shape and was opened in 1875. To reinforce
the funds, another visit to Great Britain was
determined on. We cannot go into an account of
this second visit; it is enough to say that the
singers again made their appearance in all the
principal towns of England and Scotland, and
were able to take back the sum of ten thousand
pounds; making in all as a result of their labours
the sum of thirty thousand. Since this time, the
party have made various excursions, always increasing
the funds for the erection of college buildings;
but of the exact particulars we have no
account. One of the objects in view is to erect
a building called the Livingstone Missionary Hall,
designed, as we understand, for the special preparation
of missionaries for Africa. The latest statement
we see on the subject is that the Jubilee
Singers have gone on a visit to Germany, to secure
funds to complete this building and further equip
the University for missionary work.</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of travelling at home and
abroad during several years led to changes in the
company of singers. When members were obliged
to retire, others equally qualified took their place.
At different times twenty-four persons in all have
belonged to the company. All of them have been
slaves or of slave parentage. Excepting a few
mulattoes, all have been of a pure negro type; and
their respective histories offer some interesting
facts concerning the condition of people of colour
in the slave states up till the period of general
emancipation. It is gratifying to know that the
extraordinary change of life from privation and
contumely to comfort and public respect has not
uplifted the feelings, or materially altered the habits
of the members of the corps. In their moral and
religious obligations they have ever been irreproachable.
We are told that none of them uses tobacco;
and their English friends, whose hospitalities have
been so abundant, are equally surprised, if not
gratified, to find that they are inveterate abstainers
from alcoholic liquors. Considering the temptations
and buffetings of their early life, there is not
a little to admire in the conduct as well as in the
accomplishments of the several individuals composing
the party. The energetic yet modest way
they have acquitted themselves in the routine of
the very peculiar duties imposed on them, is
probably not often met with in parties of higher
pretensions.</p>

<p>We have now in brief told the story of the
Jubilee Singers, and it is more than ordinarily
remarkable. A handful of freed negro slaves undertaking
by voluntary efforts to collect funds wherewith
to establish and support a University, having
for its object the higher education of the coloured
population in the United States. The enterprise
has had no parallel. These negroes do not beg,
nor do they trouble people for subscriptions. They
only try to raise funds by the exercise of their
talents in an honest line of industry, by communicating
pleasure to countless audiences. Amidst
the frauds and commercial rascalities of pompous
pretenders that are becoming a scandal to the age,
the unselfish and noble endeavours of these humble
melodists stand out in marked contrast, as something
to applaud and to redeem human nature.
The marvel of the enterprise has been its universal
success. High and low are equally pleased. Professing
no particular knowledge in music, but
yielding to none in an ardent admiration of the
simpler class of national ballads and songs, we have
listened to the melodies of the Jubilee Singers
with heartfelt delight. Whether with or without
instrumental accompaniment, the melodies might
be described as supplying a new relish. It has
been remarked that the greater number of the
pieces are in the same scale as that in which
Scottish music is written, with the fourth and
seventh tones omitted. This would only indicate
the untutored nature of their origin, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
wonder is greater at the effects produced. Nothing
is left for us to add but an advice to our readers.
It is, to take the earliest opportunity to go and
hear the <span class="smcap">Jubilee Singers</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="HELENA_LADY_HARROGATE" id="HELENA_LADY_HARROGATE">HELENA, LADY HARROGATE.</a></h2>


<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;AT CARBERY CHASE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> horseman, at whose approach the interesting
inmate of <i>The Traveller's Rest</i> had so abruptly
withdrawn from the place of observation whence
he was contemplating the Elizabethan front of
Carbery Court, had scarcely recognised in the
lounger smoking his pipe beneath the elm, the
bronzed seafaring fellow whom he had frequently
of late encountered. But as the man moved off
with hasty step and an evident dislike to observation,
the rider's eyes for a moment followed him.</p>

<p>&#8216;A queer customer that,&#8217; he said carelessly to
himself. &#8216;What is he, I wonder? If I saw that
ugly face of his near Ashdown Park or Newmarket
Heath, I'd lay a trifle that he was a racing tout;
in London I would class him as a dog-dealer or
dog-stealer, or possibly a sham smuggler, one of
those gruff longshore-men who waylay you with
their contraband cabbage-leaf <i>Trabucos</i>; but being
here, I think he has more the look of a real one.&#8217;</p>

<p>Having said which, he rode on, in the quiet
enjoyment of a cigar, towards the material of
which it is unlikely that the leaf of any British
vegetable had contributed; while no sound but the
jingling of the bridle-rein and the tramp of the
horse's feet broke the silence. Overhead there
soared aloft a living canopy of verdure, formed by
the mighty trees, that seemed to throw, as it were,
a succession of triumphal arches over the smooth
carriage-road, flecked with broad bars of light and
shadow. There were vistas here and there, opening
out from between the massive trees, on
which an artist's eye might have feasted, dells
clothed with beech and birch trees, fairy glens
through which trickled some brooklet fresh from
its cradle among the ridges of Dartmoor, pools
on which the water-lily floated, and around which
the deer bent down their antlered heads to
drink. But Jasper Denzil had little or no appreciation
of the charms of a landscape, and as he
rode on, the only comment which escaped him was
evoked by the sight of the superb old house, its
many windows glistening golden in the sloping
sun, as though to challenge admiration.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tiresome old jail!&#8217; he said, tossing away the
stump of his cigar. &#8216;A nice place to be mewed
up in, with the London season at high-pressure, is
this! If it were mine to do as I liked with&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; But
the only son and heir of Sir Sykes Denzil did
not definitely state the course that he should
pursue were he undisputed proprietor of Carbery
Chase.</p>

<p>Jasper, whose actual age may have been six or
at the most seven and twenty, was one of those
men of whom it is puzzling to say whether
they look, for their years, very youthful or surprisingly
old. He was below the middle height,
and his smooth pale face seemed at first sight
almost boyish; but the cold glance of the small
blue eyes, the firmness of the compressed lips, and
the tell-tale lines that were faintly visible at the
angles of both eyes and mouth, were not such as
we associate with ingenuous youth.</p>

<p>Captain Denzil (Jasper had at an early age
attained, thanks to the golden ladder by which the
offspring of wealthy men were wont to climb, his
captaincy in the light cavalry regiment to which
he had till recently belonged) had proved himself
an expensive son to Sir Sykes. His fair moustache,
pallid face, and drawling accent were well known on
race-courses, and quite familiar in those darkened
rooms at fashionable clubs where the fickle goddess
Chance is worshipped by card-players around their
lamp-lit green tables, while it is honest daylight
in the workaday world beyond.</p>

<p>He rode into the yard and dismounted; but
instead of immediately entering the house, lingered
to exchange a thoughtful word or two as to the
signs of an incipient spavin in the off fore-leg of
the fiery chestnut which he had been riding.</p>

<p>&#8216;Knew he wasn't sound of course, when I
bought him,&#8217; remarked the captain, with calm
philosophy. &#8216;A friend's horse never is, especially
when the friend is such an impulsive open-hearted
fellow as Charley Granger. But he was cheap,
and he has a turn of speed, and I've entered him
for the Pebworth Steeplechase, and don't want to
pay forfeit. So see to the bandages, Phillips, will
you; and don't have him out, except for gentle
exercise on the soft, this fortnight. We mustn't
neglect that leg.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jasper was not one of those who care for a horse,
as some of us do, for the horse's own sake, and
out of genuine love for the noblest of the dumb
servants that do the bidding of mankind. But he
did regard the genus <i>equus</i> as a very valuable
instrument for gambling purposes, and as such to
be tended with jealous care and helped, when
convenient, to victory on the turf.</p>

<p>With a slow step and a careless indolent
manner, Jasper Denzil crossed the paved yard,
and entered by a side-door the mansion that
must one day in the course of nature be his, but
of which as a place of residence we have already
heard him express an opinion the reverse of flattering.
There was very little at Carbery Chase to
amuse the captain, cut off from his usual sources
of excitement and a temporary exile from London
and its pleasures. It was sorry work this pottering
business of picking up a few ten-pound bets
on country courses, or winning paltry stakes by
the aid of wretched platers. It was better than
nothing no doubt; precisely as at Monaco we see
the ruined millionaire, Spanish or Russian, eagerly
playing for silver when his last rouleaux of louis-d'or
have taken wing; but he felt that it was a
sore degradation for one whose dash and coolness
had won dubious compliments from very great
personages.</p>

<p>Traversing a passage, Jasper presently crossed
the great hall&mdash;full of costly marbles brought from
Italy, in days when there were no manufacturers
of the spurious antique&mdash;and opened the door of
what was known as the morning-room, cheerful
and bright as a morning-room should be, and
overlooking the rose-garden, then glorious in its
glow and blush of tender colour.</p>

<p>Two ladies were the occupants of the room, both
young and both pretty, though each of them had
that likeness to Jasper (her only brother) which we
so constantly trace in members of the same family.
Lucy it is true was dark-haired and dark-eyed;
while Blanche, the younger and taller of the two,
was delicately&mdash;perhaps too delicately&mdash;fair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
complexion, and had hair of the palest gold. Sir
Sykes had been for several years a widower; and
all the Denzil family, with the exception of the
baronet himself, were now present in that room,
through the French windows of which came
stealing in the fresh scent of roses.</p>

<p>&#8216;I saw you, Jasper, from the pheasantry, as you
came up the park; but you did not see me,&#8217; said
Miss Denzil, smiling. &#8216;You did not stay, then,
to see the finish of the Pebworth cricket-match?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&mdash;no!&#8217; answered Jasper with a yawn. &#8216;Cricket
is amusing, I daresay, to those who knock the ball
about, or to those who run to pick it up again,
as the French countess said of our noble national
game; but it is slow&mdash;fearfully slow.&#8217; And the
captain yawned again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Most things are, I am afraid, at Carbery,&#8217;
said Blanche gently.&mdash;&#8216;We have tried to amuse
him&mdash;have we not, Lucy?&mdash;by dragging him
with us to such primitive merry-makings as lay
within driving distance, archery-meetings, flower-shows&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, and all manner of Arcadian entertainments
of the same species,&#8217; interrupted Jasper,
drumming with his ringed fingers on the glass of
the open window near which he was standing.
&#8216;I believe I had a narrow escape from what they
called a sillabub party at that old woman's (Lady
Di Horner's) house at Ottery St Luke's, with a
cow on the lawn and the rest of it. The natives,
I suppose, like that kind of thing; I don't.&#8217; There
was a half-peevish lassitude in his tone, in his
attitude, as he spoke, which added emphasis to
words that were, if ungracious, perhaps not
unkindly meant. But his sisters were not in the
least offended that their brother should shew so
unaffectedly how little pleasure he took in their
society, and how complete was his distaste for
their simple pleasures and homely occupations.
A grown-up brother is, in the eyes of good girls, a
hero by right of birth, and with Lucy and Blanche
the captain was a privileged person, not to be
judged by the standards of ordinary ethics.</p>

<p>&#8216;If the governor,&#8217; said Jasper, after a pause,
&#8216;would ask people down here&mdash;I mean of course
after town is empty&mdash;a houseful of people of the
right sort, why then, one might get through the
autumn and winter without being moped to
death.&#8217;</p>

<p>Lucy shook her head. &#8216;There is no chance,
brother,&#8217; she said, &#8216;that papa should fill his house
with what you would consider people of the right
sort. The Vanes will come of course, and the
Henshaws, and&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never mind the rest of the names,&#8217; broke in
the captain with a lazy brusqueness; &#8216;heavy
county members, who know more of the points of
a bullock than they do of those of a horse; and
their fat wives and starched daughters. What
have I done, to be buried alive in this way!&#8217;</p>

<p>Women have this merit, that they seldom
retort, as they might sometimes do with crushing
effect, upon a man who bewails his hard lot, be his
self-pity ever so unreasonable. Lucy and Blanche
Denzil knew, or guessed, with tolerable accuracy
that it was due to Jasper's own extravagance that
he no longer wore the gay trappings of a captain
of Lancers, and that the soles of his varnished
boots were no longer familiar with the Pall-Mall
pavement.</p>

<p>&#8216;I'll go in and see my father; he's in the
library, I suppose?&#8217; said Jasper, and without
waiting for an answer, he sauntered off.</p>

<p>Sir Sykes Denzil was a man of methodical
habits, and his son's conjecture that he would be
found at that hour in the library was quite warranted,
not only by fact, but by his daily practice.
On his way thither the young man passed by the
suite of drawing-rooms, only the smallest of which
was ever used, save on the occasions, not too
frequent, when some great dinner-party or possibly
a dance at Carbery Chase set all the neighbouring
lanes and roads aglow with carriage-lamps.
With all its splendour, the Court was what might
be described as a dull house; the master of which
had never made the most, even for selfish purposes,
of his large share in the good things of this
world.</p>

<p>The library, Sir Sykes's favourite room, was
a stately apartment, with gilt cornices and a
richly painted ceiling. It overlooked the stone
terrace whereon, amidst statues and marble vases
overbrimming with scarlet geraniums, the peacocks
strutted. The great central window was of ancient
stained glass, and from its quaint panes in their
leaden setting flashed forth the lost colours of
the blue and crimson, deemed inimitable for
centuries past, but which probably owed their
peculiar beauty to the corroding touch of time.
This window, of which honourable mention was
made in the county guide-book aforesaid, glimmered
with heraldic blazonry, wherein the couchant
greyhounds of the present owners of Carbery
found no place.</p>

<p>The baronet, who was seated at his writing-table,
strewn with papers, looked up as he heard
the opening of the door, and greeted his son
with rather a conventional smile of recognition.
&#8216;So you are back with us earlier than usual,
Jasper,&#8217; he said, in a tone that was polite, but
scarcely cordial. The young man's voice, as usual
with him when he addressed his father, had lost
much of the languid insolence which habit had
rendered natural to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir; I don't care much for cricket, so I
did not stay to see the end of it. So far as I could
hear, the Zingari were beating the County hollow.
But as I said before, that style of thing is not
much in my line.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Better for you, my boy, if it had been,&#8217;
returned the baronet dryly. &#8216;A young fellow
cannot break his health or ruin his fortunes at
cricket, as more fashionable pastimes may help
him to do.&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain winced and reddened. &#8216;I didn't
expect a lecture, father,&#8217; he said peevishly. &#8216;Indeed
I'm not likely to forget the crasher I came
down with, that my misfortunes should be thrown
in my teeth every day I live.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We will let the subject drop,&#8217; said the baronet
after a momentary pause. &#8216;Who were at Pebworth
to-day? No lack of company, I suppose? Our
friends hereabouts are not all as complete cosmopolitans
as you are, Jasper; and some of the
ladies at anyrate may have gone there in hopes
of seeing Devon win the game.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jasper half sullenly made answer that he could
scarcely say who were there. &#8216;Fulfords and Courtenays
and the Carews, and the people from
Prideaux Park, yes; and the De Vere girls, and
Harrogate their brother. The old Earl wasn't
there, and the ladies went on horseback.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;Lady Gladys looks well on horseback,&#8217; observed
Sir Sykes with a sidelong glance at his son.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; and rides nicely,&#8217; answered Jasper with
an air of the most utter indifference; and then
the eyes of the father and the son met, not frankly,
but as the eyes of two wary fencing-masters might
do at the instant of crossing swords. Sir Sykes
and Jasper were not, so far as outward seeming
went, in the least alike. The common attribute
of worldliness they did indeed share, but neither
in looks nor in manner did they resemble each
other. The baronet was a tall and handsome
man, whose dark hair was now dashed with gray,
and his high forehead deeply lined, but who still
presented to the eyes of the world a showy exterior
and a bearing that was at once dignified and
urbane. That he was not in perfect health could
only be conjectured from the slowness of his step,
and those faintly marked furrows near the corners
of the shapely mouth, in which a shrewd physician
might have read of mischief silently at work;
but to unprofessional scrutiny he appeared simply
as a gentleman of a goodly presence.</p>

<p>A melancholy man, albeit a proud and a courteous
one, Sir Sykes was known to be. And
singularly enough, the baronet's sadness was supposed
to date from the day when he had lost, long
years ago, the eldest of his three daughters, a
little girl to whom he was rumoured to have been
unusually attached. This was the odder, because
Sir Sykes was not the sort of man who is generally
credited with very deep feelings or a peculiar
strength of family affection. He had borne his
wife's decease with polished equanimity; but those
who had known him in his early poverty and in
his subsequent prosperity averred that the lord of
Carbery had never been the same man since the
death of this child.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish,&#8217; said Sir Sykes, speaking slowly, and
poising a gold-hafted paper-knife between his soft
white fingers&mdash;&#8216;I wish I could see you married
and settled.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The settling, if, as I suppose, it means the
making of a suitable settlement, makes the main
impediment to marrying, with some of us at least,&#8217;
rejoined Jasper with mock gravity; but before his
father could reply, a servant entered bringing a
letter. Sir Sykes mechanically took up the letter
from the silver tray and as mechanically opened
it. But his eyes had hardly glanced at the first
half-page before a great and sudden change came
over his calm face; he grew white, almost livid,
to his very lips, and let his hand which held the
open letter drop heavily upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you ill, sir?&#8217; said Jasper quickly and with
a sort of anxiety unusual with him. It was impossible
to avoid taking notice of the baronet's
very evident emotion; impossible too not to
connect the cause of it with the letter which Sir
Sykes held in his hand. But the master of
Carbery Chase rallied himself, and though his face
was even ghastly in its pallor and his breath
came painfully, he managed to smile as he rejoined:
&#8216;Not ill. It is a mere pain, a spasm at
most, which comes at times, but goes as quickly,
or nearly so, as it comes. It is a trifle, not worth
the talking about. It is getting late, and I have
a note or two to write and some papers to look
over before the dressing-bell rings. We shall
meet at dinner presently.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jasper rose to go. &#8216;I hardly like&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; he began.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am better; I am well; it is nothing,&#8217; interrupted
Sir Sykes irritably; and then blandly
added: &#8216;I thank you, my dear boy, for your
solicitude, but I am best alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jasper had not proceeded two paces along the
carpeted corridor before he heard the key of the
library door turned from within.</p>

<p>&#8216;I'd give a cool hundred,&#8217; said this exemplary
youth, &#8216;to look over my father's shoulder as he
reads that letter. To have a hold on the governor
would&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; He left the rest of the sentence unspoken,
and passed on, leaving Sir Sykes in the
locked-up library to the company of his own
solitary thoughts.</p>



<hr class="chap" /></div><div>
<h2><a name="TIGER-SHOOTING" id="TIGER-SHOOTING">TIGER-SHOOTING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Tiger-shooting</span> in India differs a trifle from the
tame pursuit of game in England&mdash;a very different
thing indeed from the miserable amusement of the
<i>battue</i>, in which hundreds of defenceless creatures
are shot down without any chance of danger to
the shooter. To go out tiger-shooting is to run
the risk of encountering a deadly enemy, which on
grounds of public policy it is of importance to
destroy. So much as a preliminary observation.</p>

<p>The danger connected with tiger-shooting varies
very much in proportion to the conditions under
which it is prosecuted. Thus a man on foot following
the fresh tracks of a tiger up to his lair,
and shooting him as he lies, or following him up
on foot when wounded, incurs the maximum risk.
In all cases, after being wounded, ungovernable
fury and a fierce longing for revenge take the place
of that instinctive fear or shyness of man which
tigers share with all other wild animals. This instinctive
dread of man is so well known to the tribes
who inhabit the forests of India, that even solitary
individuals will hail the prospect of suddenly
encountering a tiger, provided, of course, that he is
not a man-eater. They know their safety at such
a moment lies in preserving a composed attitude
and demeanour. The tiger will often yield the
right of way; but if the human subject finds it
necessary to set that example in the way of politeness,
he knows it to be absolutely essential to the
preservation of his life that he should do so with
every appearance of self-possession, and without
any signs of fear or precipitancy. A passage in
<i>King Richard III.</i> accurately reflects the line of
conduct which should be observed, holding good
as it does equally with reference to the tiger:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To fly the boar, before the boar pursues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were to incense the boar to follow us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In proportion to the successful days, the number
of blank days in tiger-shooting is extraordinarily
large, as the experience of most shikarees will
confirm. This is owing to &#8216;hanks&#8217; or beats being
so often badly planned or mismanaged; through
which tigers escape which might otherwise have
easily been brought to book. The dry and
denuded state of an Indian jungle during the hot
weather makes that the most fitting season for
tiger-shooting. Indeed it is the only season in
which the sport can be undertaken with a reasonable
prospect of success. The available covers for
a tiger are then much reduced in number and
extent; and in the inverse ratio are the chances
increased of the animal's not betaking himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
some distant locality before the plan of action
which is intended to effect his destruction has had
time to develop itself. In other words, any faint
and accidental signs of a disturbance in a tiger's
vicinity will rouse him from his lair, and drive
him to green patch or snug retreat miles away,
if the weather be cool and cover abundant;
whereas with very hot weather and extensive
denudation of shade, he will prefer remaining
where he is until the sounds assume too decided
a character to be mistaken; when the probabilities
are that the sportsman will be perfectly
ready on his making a move.</p>

<p>The great point to remember in arranging to
hunt a tiger is that one of his most prominent
characteristics is cunning&mdash;and that this <i>must be
met by cunning</i>. This is not sufficiently studied,
especially by beginners. Eager and enthusiastic
for the fray, and for the thrill of satisfaction
which the all-important moment of the actual
kill inspires, the inexperienced sportsman is too
apt to overlook those precautions and preparations
which are essential aids to success; or he
relies upon others for doing in the above respects
what he should attend to himself. The first
thing to be done on arriving at the ground
where a tiger has safely been marked down
by the early despatched scouts is to acquaint
one's self thoroughly with its topography. The
nature of the ground varies very much; consisting
sometimes of a pile of rocks rising from a
plain, of a confused mass of hills, or of a large
single hill, a river or small water-course stocked
with green bushes, and with level jungle or perhaps
open ground bordering on both sides; and so on.
On being roused from his lair in say a water-course
by the beaters, a tiger is very likely to cross over
into the jungle, especially if another ravine is not
far off to which he can retire. He does so with
the express object of getting rid of his disturbers
as soon as possible; or let us say that instinct
tells him that an entire change of locality is most
conducive to his safety. On the other hand, if
there be no adjoining cover, a tiger will keep to
the same channel and steal along its course. The
difference between the two cases represents the
comparative prospect of a tiger being bagged.
When a tiger is compelled to steal along the
channel from which he has been roused, the prospect
becomes nearly a certainty, assuming the
&#8216;hank&#8217; to be conducted in a correct manner.</p>

<p>A very slight noise, such as slight coughing,
will sometimes start a tiger; while he will at other
times refuse to move, although even shots should
be fired into the bush or among the rocks where
he may be lying concealed. As Colonel Rice,
late of the Bombay army, very justly remarks
in his book entitled <i>Tiger-shooting in India</i>&mdash;and
the writer's own experience is entirely corroborative
of that statement&mdash;no two tigers can be
depended on for behaving exactly alike under the
same circumstances. An old tiger, and especially
one which has been hunted before, is extremely
wary, and very difficult to circumvent with even
good management; while a young one readily
falls a victim, like any other greenhorn. A tigress
with young cubs is always very savage, and will
sometimes charge anybody approaching her den or
other resting-place before her own presence is at
all suspected. Three men in the service of the
writer were once obliged to take refuge on a rock
only some six or seven feet high, where an angry
tigress bayed them, and repeatedly threatened to
charge home for at least two hours. One of the
men was armed with a sword, and the other two
had nothing but sticks in their hands. The tigress
crouched at the very foot of the rock, which was
small but flat-topped, over and over again. She
there alternately blinked and glared at the unfortunate
men, who only succeeded in keeping her off
from actually springing on them by dint of vigorous
and incessant shouting, and constantly changing
front, according as the tigress herself kept
moving from one side of the rock to another, and
occasionally retiring a few paces, and then stealing
forward and crouching again. The state of their
throats and the terribly husky whisper to which
their voices were in the end reduced, may easily
be imagined. However, down to their humblest
followers, hunters as a rule are a merry set, and
directly actual danger has passed away the danger
is forgotten.</p>

<p>In large covers there are often outlets and lines
of exit, in addition to those guarded by a party of
say four or five sportsmen, who post themselves at
the most important points. These all require to
be blocked up, so that a tiger, should he attempt
to escape by any of them, may be readily turned
on to a path which will draw him under fire. One
of the covers in which the writer was fortunate
enough to bag several tigers in different years, consisted
of a river of about a hundred and fifty yards
width, with ravines branching out at different
points, and low hills bordering the banks. It was
impracticable with fewer than a hundred men, and
was best driven by elephants, in consequence of
the thick and tangled state of the bushes. It was
a piece of ground of the kind described above,
offering numerous outlets, as the cover extended
right under one of the banks, and ran for some
distance along the length of the river; while the
bank itself was of no great height, and might
be ascended in a moment at any point. The
method of blocking up the outlets which the
sportsmen themselves cannot watch, is to place
over them, on trees, the sharpest and most intelligent
of the men that can be selected from among
the beaters. They should be instructed to strike
the tree with a stone taken up in the hand for
that purpose, or to employ any other simple
process of producing a noise, so that the tiger may
be headed back the moment he is seen to be
advancing, and his intention is unmistakable. A
blank shot will be necessary to turn a <i>rapidly</i>
advancing tiger; and a matchlock or spare gun
in the hands of a competent person should in
such cases be kept in reserve. Many of the
rivers in India during the hunting season are
perfectly dry beds, except as to a mere rill or
narrow stream. The actual water's edge is, however,
almost sure to be the tiger's position, if
fringed by bushes sufficiently large to afford him
shelter; for he delights in lapping the water
frequently, and in laving his limbs during the
hottest hours of the day.</p>

<p>With respect to the height a tiger will clear
at a bound or series of bounds, some uncertainty
seems to prevail. In Captain Shakspeare's
<i>Wild Sports of India</i>, the author, when twelve
feet up a tree, scarcely thought himself beyond
the reach of the man-eater he was expecting,
as he believed a tiger capable of springing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
that height. In the book of Colonel Gordon Gumming
(a brother of the African hunter), a sad case
is recorded of his gun-bearer being pulled out
of a tree and killed by a wounded tiger through
incautiously standing only some eight feet above
the ground. But points of this nature are altogether
of a secondary character, the slightest
vantage-ground being sufficient if the requisites
are preserved of a cool head and steady hand to
guide the management of an efficient weapon.</p>

<p>To the generality of tastes, the most satisfactory
method of hunting tigers is with and upon a well-trained
elephant. But when the arrangements are
on a very extensive scale, they fail of anything
like due effect. On special occasions, elephants
have been employed in the hunting-field by the
score, and also by the hundred, as in the case
of the Prince of Wales's excursions in Nepaul.
A cordon of eight hundred elephants was then
employed to inclose a jungle and to drive the
game on to a central point; but the bag, though
good, was disproportionately small, looking to the
means and labour employed. Better results might
have been obtained if the ground had been traversed
in sections with only a few elephants,
though this would have required more time,
which probably could not be spared. The great
object to be kept in view in approaching a tiger
for the purpose of obtaining a fair shot, is to do as
little as possible towards startling the beast until
within a few yards, even though obstructions such
as bushes or rocks intervene; for when once a
&#8216;scare&#8217; is excited, a tiger will break through an
inclosing line of elephants and probably escape
altogether; whereas by being quietly followed up
with scouts previously sent forward to note and
telegraph his progress, the chances are all in favour
of the sportsman.</p>

<p>In hilly tracts where the hills run in long
ridges and are flanked or intersected by ravines,
as in Rajpootana, tiger-shooting may at all times
be conducted on foot with comparative safety.
This was successfully done by Colonel (then
Lieutenant) Rice from twenty to twenty-five years
back. He never once employed an elephant, and
treats the notion of doing so with a certain amount
of disdain. Confessing to a desire to employ his
rifle on the tigers in the island of Singapore,
which is (or certainly was) very much infested by
them, he remarks: &#8216;There the old notion prevails
that without elephants tigers are best let alone.&#8217;
Evidently the Colonel does not consider the elephant
a necessary adjunct to the sport, nor did
he really find it so. There can, however, be no
question that in large swamps and grass tracts,
and in fact under all circumstances, an elephant is
a most powerful auxiliary, whose importance cannot
be over-rated. If trees and such positions are
taken to meet the tiger when he first breaks, the
advantage of afterwards following him up on an
elephant if only wounded, is too obvious to need
any comment. But it is of course absolutely necessary
that the elephant should be one which can
be depended on for making a firm stand before a
tiger. The more steady the elephant, the better
the aim that can be taken; but the uninitiated
should know that there is always some slight
oscillatory movement in an elephant, so that a
small though perhaps an infinitesimal measure
of calculation has to be applied in shooting from
its back. From a neglect of this necessity,
tigers are sometimes missed at absurdly close
quarters, though there may be no actual change
in the elephant's position to account for the circumstance,
and to justify the miss. On the other
hand, as sometimes happens, an elephant may very
seriously incommode or perhaps precipitate his
rider to the ground, by actually charging a tiger
and dropping down on his knees, in order the
better to crush the foe. At the same time, an
elephant that bolts jeopardises his rider's life in a
worse degree, by the reckless manner in which he
pursues his flight. Should the jungle consist of
trees, there is almost a certainty of the howdah
being dashed up against them, or of its being
swept off by some projecting bough, which affords
a clear passage to the body of the elephant, but
not to the howdah and those seated in it. The
latter, therefore, run a serious risk of being badly
injured or of losing their lives.</p>

<p>One important essential for the obtaining of
sport is a liberal expenditure of money. It
both sweetens labour and smooths the path to
danger. To keep an elephant in prime hearty
condition costs about fifteen pounds a month,
and good elephants may occasionally be borrowed
from native chiefs through the instrumentality
of political officers; but unless one has influence
enough to insure his being thus favoured, he
should make up his mind to hunt on foot. Many
men have done, and still do so with the most satisfactory
results; while with respect to elephants,
some special elements of risk exist, which prove
fatal entirely from a want of common forethought.
Thus, an unfortunate officer of one of Her
Majesty's regiments serving in India ventured into
a jungle after a tiger, seated merely on the pad on
which a howdah is made to rest; he was thrown
off, and fell into the jaws of the enraged beast.
A person seated in this manner is at any moment
liable to be thrown by a sudden swerve, and such
an occurrence is extremely likely when a tiger
charges, or suddenly appears before an elephant.
The writer remembers an instance within his own
experience of being mounted on an elephant off
whose back at least a hundred tigers had at
various times been killed, and which was therefore
generally very staunch, and of there being a
second and third elephant on each side of the
first; yet on a panther very little bigger than a
large cat charging from a bush, the three elephants
together turned in an instant and ignominiously
retreated for about a dozen yards. The shock of
the movement was so great that he was forced back
on the seat from which he had just risen the
moment before, and must have infallibly been
hurled to the ground had he been seated on a pad
only. It should therefore be adopted as a rule
never to be deviated from, that a tiger should not
be approached on an elephant otherwise than in a
properly constructed howdah.</p>

<p>But as a contrast to the behaviour of the panther
above referred to, a large tiger will sometimes
altogether refuse to face an elephant, and will
retreat from point to point of a cover until he at
last becomes an easy victim; which shews in
what extremely opposite lights the subject requires
to be looked at.</p>

<p>The duty of arranging a proper plan of attack
upon a tiger in any known position is sometimes
delegated by the English sportsman to his head
native shikaree, who is qualified for that task both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
by a certain aptitude and a considerable amount of
experience; but the best of such men are apt sometimes
to fail, and close supervision of them is
consequently always necessary. Besides, they are
generally trained by those who have them in their
service; and a long course of association and
reciprocal action between master and servant is
needed to produce an efficient henchman. It is
therefore advisable for men who are about to
begin tiger-shooting to take their initiatory lessons
in jungle-craft under the guidance of some brother-sportsman,
who can be looked on as a sort of distinguished
professor who has already graduated
with honours in his studies.</p>

<p class='ph3'>IN FOUR CHAPTERS.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE STORY OF RUTH.</h3>

<p>&#8216;<span class="smcap">I can't</span> think whatever's come over Nathan; he's
that queer there's no such thing as making of him
out.&#8217; This remark was addressed by Mark Day, the
tenor bell-ringer, to Obadiah Lang, who rang the
third bell, a few days after the events narrated in
the previous chapter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; responded Obadiah. &#8216;There's the practisin'
for Christmas-eve, the practisin' for the carols
and for the hymns a' Christmas-day; he don't seem
to care about them at all, and when I says to him:
&#8220;How about the evergreens for the church?&#8221; he
stared hard, and said: &#8220;I'll see;&#8221; and walked off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That ain't all neither,&#8217; said Mark Day. &#8216;He's
wonderful curious about his house. He don't ask
nobody in, but stands agen the door, with it in
his hand, and seems afraid all the time you are
talking to him. My opinion is, trouble's turned
his brain. If he don't alter, I shall speak to the
parson.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don't do nothing you're sorry for afterwards,&#8217;
replied Obadiah. &#8216;Y' see Nathan ain't like one of
us; he mostly have his reasons for everythink,
which ain't the case with everybody nowadays:
it's all talk and no do with the many.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this moment some one made his way to the
churchyard, and to that some one, the men touched
their hats respectfully. It was Oliver Peregrine.
He brushed past quickly; but had the men been
keen observers, they might have noticed that
his face was pale and his air abstracted. He
was going for a long and solitary walk, his
custom when any matter disturbed him, or as
Gertrude Peregrine said, &#8216;when he had a fit of
the blues.&#8217; He was not favoured by that young
lady, who secretly wondered how Patricia could
fancy him. To her sister, Gertrude said nothing
of her choice, for Patricia was reserved and distant
even to her nearest of kin. Few could imagine
how deeply she loved this silent studious
man. He himself was far from guessing the depth
of her affection, his own being centred not on
Patricia but on her inheritance, which would be his
by marriage. All his life he had coveted a position
with wealth to support it; had determined to make
it his; had planned and worked for it; when,
just as he was on the point of attaining his ends,
Death stepped in, and for the time frustrated his
hopes. Again the time drew near, and again Death
intervened; while impatient of the delay, the arrival
of Colonel Lindsay, whom he well remembered,
proved a further source of annoyance.</p>

<p>Oliver and the Colonel had been secret antagonists
in days gone by; for the latter, a brave,
honest, God-fearing soldier, disliked the character
of the younger man, whom he mistrusted; and
from his long and close intimacy with Squire
Peregrine, felt at liberty to search into matters
of which he had heard, but seen nothing. After
some years spent in India, he had returned, to
find changes at Linden Hall which grieved and
even displeased him. He felt more than ever
disposed to mistrust Oliver, but like a skilful
tactician, knew that his plans must be laid with
the utmost secrecy; his enemies being the obstinate
and unforgiving disposition of his old friend,
the craftiness of Oliver, and his ignorance of the
whereabouts of the outlawed son, to whom he had
acted as god-father, and for whom he entertained a
true affection. He had heard the story as related
by Dobson, whose fidelity was unimpeachable; but
found that even that faithful dependent was
obliged to acknowledge that the case was as clear
as the day, and that Mr Bertram would never be
forgiven by his father.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never, sir,&#8217; concluded Dobson; &#8216;not if he was
dying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And how about the girl's brother, Dobson?
You mentioned her brother. Is he still alive?
And does he manifest a vindictive spirit towards&mdash;towards
my god-son?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not he, sir. Nathan Boltz has forgiven him
years ago. Poor Ruth forgave him long before she
died; but my master will never forgive him. My
mistress died with his name upon her lips; I
believe waiting for his return had killed her. It
is a sad history, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>Colonel Lindsay had made up his mind he
would hear the story from the lips of Nathan
himself, and at once. Therefore, on the evening of
the day when Mark Day and Obadiah Lang had
conversed respecting Nathan, there came a gentle
tap on the cottage door, which the owner cautiously
opened. In a few words the Colonel made it
known that he desired to speak to him; and with
some hesitation Nathan bid him enter. The
Colonel had excused himself after dinner from
returning to the drawing-room, and had wrapped a
large cloak over him by way of disguise; this
and his fur cap and muffler prevented Nathan from
discovering the rank of his visitor until they were
seated in the neat and pleasant room in which he
usually lived. The cottage staircase led from the
kitchen to the floor above; but the door which
opened upon the kitchen was shut.</p>

<p>Nathan waited for Colonel Lindsay to speak;
he knew that he was a visitor at the Hall, and
yet he shewed little anxiety concerning what he
might have to say to him. But when the Colonel,
with soldierly authority, made known who he was,
and that he came for the purpose of hearing the sad
story of his sister's life, in order to forward the
ends of justice; then Nathan's hands trembled,
his lip quivered, and in a low voice he begged to
be excused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; replied Colonel Lindsay with decision and
yet kindness in his tone; &#8216;you must tell me the
whole of the particulars, either here or in a court
of justice; for I am determined to search them out,
for reasons which I shall hereafter explain.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nathan gazed at his visitor inquiringly, then
gathering his resolution together, he said: &#8216;If your
object, Colonel Lindsay, be to bring the offender
to justice, I must utterly decline either in this
place or any other to open my lips upon the
subject. I will never betray him. I mean that I
will give no evidence, not even if I am punished
for withholding it.&#8217; He spoke under considerable
excitement, but still with caution in his
manner.</p>

<p>This was not lost upon the Colonel, who
answered: &#8216;Would you shield your sister's betrayer,
the man who beguiled her, and then left her to
sustain herself as best she might?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He did not do that,&#8217; replied Nathan; &#8216;she
received an allowance as long as she lived. But I
promised her on her dying bed never to reveal
anything concerning her; and can I, ought I to
break that promise?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes!&#8217; answered the Colonel decidedly. &#8216;Nathan
Boltz, you may trust me not to make use of my
knowledge against the author of all this sorrow,
for the sake of my old friend, for the sake of his
son. Can you not trust me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir, I will trust you; but you will not&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; He
paused.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will do nothing without your consent,&#8217; said
Colonel Lindsay. &#8216;And now, let me hear it, for
time passes. Please, begin at the beginning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My father,&#8217; began Nathan, &#8216;was a Dutch sailor.
My mother died when Ruth was thirteen, and I two
years older. After her death&mdash;which happened
at a time when my father had returned from a
voyage&mdash;he did not go to sea any more, but
became a labourer under Squire Peregrine, and
kept a house for me and Ruth. The Squire was
very kind to my father and his orphans; and after
a time Ruth learned the dressmaking, and I was
apprenticed to the head gardener at the Hall. My
sister was a beautiful girl, the belle of the village,
and as modest as she was pretty. We were very
happy, until the Squire's son came home from
college, and began to notice Ruth in a manner
which led my father to warn her to beware. She
smiled in her innocence, and told him he was
mistaken; and as we saw little or nothing of Mr
Bertram, the feeling died out. Thus matters
remained for more than a year. But when I was
twenty and Ruth eighteen, the blow fell with
crushing effect upon us all. We rose one morning
to find her gone, and to hear that Mr Bertram
had also disappeared, after forging his father's
name for five hundred pounds. It was useless to
pursue the fugitives, even if we had had any clue
to their flight; and our desire was frustrated by
orders from Squire Peregrine to abandon all search.
Day after day we waited and hoped. But it was
some months before poor Ruth made her way to
us, footsore and weary, and begging forgiveness for
her sin. Then we knew that he had not married
her; and my father went nigh mad with anger. We
had been poor, but free from shame. He thanked
God that my mother was dead; and followed her
soon after the death of Ruth's baby, which lived
only a few weeks. From time to time Mr Bertram
sent her money, and when I mentioned him,
she always answered: &#8220;Have patience, Nathan.
He will marry me soon. Do not question me; only
trust me.&#8221; I was very bitter against him then,
and would have killed him if we had met. I told
Ruth so; and she shuddered and prayed we might
never meet until he had done her justice. So the
weary time went on; poor Ruth hopeful and
patient; so patient, that I used to wonder how she
could live alone year after year and not try to find
him, not go mad with grief and disappointment.
But so it was. I could never understand her.
We cannot all bear trouble alike, sir&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Nathan stopped suddenly, and turned his face
away.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go on,&#8217; said Colonel Lindsay, rather anxiously,
consulting his watch; and Nathan obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8216;My sister and I lived together in this manner
for more than ten years. She supported herself
by dressmaking, and was fully employed, for her
history was known, and she was deeply pitied.
As she received a regular allowance from Mr
Bertram, she must have known at such times
where he was; but never allowed me to see or
hear anything of her proceedings. Sometimes
my violence frightened her. I know now how
blind and wrong I was. The Squire, who is a
true gentleman, gave me the office of bell-ringer
and sexton, and made us many valuable presents;
and it was understood that no mention should
ever be made by either of us of the blight
and sorrow of our life. But one day when my
sister heard from Mr Dobson that his young
master's name was struck out of the will, and that
the young ladies were to be brought up in ignorance
that they had a brother, she came home
in great distress; and one evening soon after,
when she had been with some work to a distant
farm, she fainted on this spot where I now sit,
causing me great alarm. She would not reveal
the cause of her illness; and from that time,
which was two years from the date of Mr Bertram's
flight, I said nothing to her of her sorrow
and its cause. Ten years after that her health
gave way, and I saw that her sickness was unto
death. Inwardly, I vowed vengeance on the man
who had wrought this foul wrong; outwardly, I
remained calmly waiting for the end. Every luxury
was sent her from the Hall; but Mrs Peregrine
did not visit her; no doubt she was forbidden, as
her nature was both gentle and forgiving. However,
when the end was near at hand, Ruth implored
me to fetch her, and I did so. The urgency
of my manner prevailed, and she came immediately,
alone and on foot. It was too late; Death had
arrived before her; and after a few kind words
to me, she left. I found all the money Ruth
had received from Mr Bertram put by, and used
a portion of it for funeral expenses. From the
day of her death I was a changed man. She had
besought me, charged me, as I would meet her
hereafter, to conquer even a desire for vengeance,
and had commended Mr Bertram to my care and
protection, should he ever return; and so vehement
was her manner and so solemn her tone, that I
made a vow to obey her dying injunction; and
have kept it. I have forgiven, as I hope to be
forgiven.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again Nathan paused, while a strange peacefulness
gathered over his face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you finished?&#8217; inquired his visitor, much
moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;Not quite. Soon after the date of Ruth's death,
all remittances ceased; and I concluded that he
who had sent them was dead. This was one circumstance
worth notice. The other, that shortly
before her death Mrs Peregrine sent for me, and
charged me that should her son return, I would
neither do nor say anything to widen the breach
between him and his father. For &#8220;Nathan,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I feel convinced that some day he <i>will</i>
return. Therefore, for the sake of poor Ruth, who
is gone, and for my sake, who will soon follow her,
promise me that you will do what you can to
bring them together; promise me, Nathan! I have
always been so grieved that I was too late to hear
what your sister had to say. Poor girl, she had a
claim on us, although the world would have
smiled at the idea. It is just possible that she
might have been married to my son. What do
you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;I told her I thought not; but added that my
sister had been very secret in all that she had said
and done.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;'Tis a great relief to speak of my poor boy,&#8221;
said Mrs Peregrine, who seemed to forget all
difference in rank; &#8220;and this will be the last time,
Nathan, that we may meet on earth. Bear my
words in mind. My end is peace, but one cannot
have peace without forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;I left her almost awe-stricken; it was so wonderful
to have had this lesson twice repeated. Neither
had said a word of the wrong done to them; it
seemed to have faded out before the joy and peace
which filled their hearts, and which now fills
mine.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nathan paused, and again the bright look stole
into his face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well?&#8217; said Colonel Lindsay.</p>

<p>&#8216;That is all, sir,&#8217; answered Nathan, evidently
relieved that his visitor rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing more?&#8217; pursued the Colonel, as he
buttoned his cloak. He looked straight at Nathan,
whose eyes fell before the soldier's searching glance.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; he hesitated&mdash;&#8216;nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was silence. Suddenly a voice from a
room above called &#8216;Nathan!&#8217; twice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Whose voice is that?&#8217; exclaimed Colonel Lindsay.
&#8216;I thought you lived alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do; but this is a friend who is ill, and is
staying with me for a time. Excuse me, sir, but I
am wanted.&#8217;</p>

<p>Again the call for Nathan.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go to your friend,&#8217; said the Colonel; &#8216;I will
not detain you. After you have attended to his
wants, come back to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Very unwillingly Nathan opened the staircase
door; but no sooner had he turned to go upstairs
than he found his visitor behind him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go on,&#8217; he said, as he paused. &#8216;I can read you
like a book.&#8217; Another moment, and Colonel Lindsay
had clasped the hands of Bertram Peregrine,
and Nathan had left the two alone.</p>

<p>Alone with Bertram, the Colonel heard his story,
sympathised in his trials, related all that had been
told him by the Squire, and promised to act as
mediator between father and son; for he entertained
no doubts as to the truth of the statement,
having always believed his god-son sinned against
rather than sinning. At the same time he congratulated
himself on his true perception of character.</p>

<p>When Colonel Lindsay returned to the Hall he
was in a fever of anxiety, distress, and hope; what
steps to take he could not tell, but determined to
have but one confidant, Nathan Boltz.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;TOLLING THE CURFEW.</h3>

<p>Oliver Peregrine hated Nathan Boltz; but
nobody suspected it, least of all Nathan himself.
Oliver longed for the time to come when as Squire
of Linden he could shew his hatred, for which he
considered he had satisfactory reasons: one being,
that Nathan was a favourite in the village and
Oliver was disliked; another, that he was a protégé
of the Squire's; a third, that he had been a
great hinderance to Oliver's schemes. And now
this Colonel Lindsay seemed to be smitten with
the bell-ringer, for he frequently engaged him in
conversation and met him in the belfry to inspect
the bells. Evidently the Colonel was mad on the
subject of bell-ringing.</p>

<p>But at the end of a fortnight it occurred to
Oliver, who was always prying and suspecting,
that their visitor must have some deeper motive
than this love of bells and their ringers. He set
himself to watch. Just now the Hall was very
quiet. Christmas would be kept entirely by themselves,
therefore Oliver had plenty of leisure. He
said nothing to Patricia of his suspicions; he was
not communicative, and she forbore to question
him.</p>

<p>To Gertrude, Oliver had never appeared more
distasteful than at this time; and she missed the
presence of the sweet sister in whom she had
confided; for Gertrude had her romance. A very
degrading affair Patricia would have called it.
However, no one knew of it. Indeed Gertrude
had dared scarcely confess it to herself. She loved
with the depth and purity of a Christian maiden.
Whom? None other than Nathan the bell-ringer!
Fearful was Gertrude of whispering his name even
in the solitude of her chamber. Yet it afforded
her a melancholy pleasure that he should have
prepared the last resting-places of her mother and
sister, and that in some manner, she did not quite
know how, his life should be connected with her
family.</p>

<p>&#8216;But what recompense can we make him,&#8217; she
would argue, &#8216;in return for Bertram's wrong? Even
my father acknowledges that he did this wrong,
and has made him pay in full the penalty of his
sin.&#8217; And then she would sigh, as she felt how
hopeless, how almost criminal was her love. In
vain, however, she struggled against it. In her
eyes Nathan was the true type of a gentleman;
and &#8216;Oh!&#8217; she would cry, &#8216;if Bertram felt thus
for Ruth, how could he&mdash;how could he forsake
her in her time of need?&#8217;</p>

<p>Sometimes Gertrude had feared that Oliver
Peregrine would discover her secret, or suspect
her, from her having already refused certain
eligible connections approved by her father; but
she had no cause to fear: her family had not the
most remote suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>Christmas drew near, while Colonel Lindsay
continued his visits to the belfry, where, as we
know, certain weighty considerations detained him
in converse with Nathan; and several times
Oliver had watched the Colonel emerge from the
cottage of the man he so detested. At last, with
some difficulty, Oliver managed to play the eavesdropper,
and gathered from their conversation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
the subject of it was closely connected with his
uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&mdash;if?&#8217; he muttered to himself, but dared
not complete his question; and as he walked
home, after the Colonel had left Nathan, he grew
more and more uneasy, and determined to find out
for himself the secret of Nathan's attic window,
where for the last fortnight a light had been
observed. Conceive his annoyance when, on commencing
a cross-examination of the Colonel in
a friendly tone, he found the old soldier on his
guard, and ready to parry every attack. Foiled
on every side by the experienced veteran, Oliver
altered his tactics, and made up his mind to use
force, as stratagem availed nothing, and to wring
the secret from Nathan Boltz.</p>

<p>It was on a dark starless evening that Nathan
set out to toll the curfew, accompanied by
Bertram Peregrine, who having recovered in a
great measure from the effects of his fatigue and
exposure, desired to revisit the well-remembered
church, in which many of his ancestors were
buried. Colonel Lindsay had arranged to meet
him there to decide upon an immediate course of
action; and the belfry was to be the scene of their
consultation. Nathan and his patient soon reached
the belfry, whence the tolling of the curfew
was to be the signal for the Colonel to join
them. But Oliver had invented a mysterious
communication which should detain the Colonel
in waiting for an imaginary visitor, and give him
the opportunity of going instead; therefore while
the soldier waited impatiently at the Hall for
his unknown correspondent, Oliver borrowed his
cloak, and opening the door in the wall before
mentioned, entered the churchyard and repaired
to the church.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hear the Colonel; he has just come in,&#8217; said
Nathan. &#8216;Will you shew a light, Mr Bertram?&#8217;
As he spoke he continued the tolling of the
curfew; and his companion descended the stairs
with the lantern in his hand; but he saw no one,
for Oliver was concealed in the deep shadow of
the porch.</p>

<p>Just as Bertram stepped forward saying: &#8216;This
way, Colonel Lindsay,&#8217; the lantern was dashed
from his hand, and a violent blow felled him
to the ground. He rose and grappled with his
antagonist, who maintained a dead silence, until
slipping over the steps into the interior of the
church, they fell with violence on the stone floor;
at the same moment Bertram felt a sharp wound
in his side, and uttered a loud cry as Nathan
rushed from the belfry bearing a candle in his
hand. He saw before him Oliver Peregrine about
to escape from the scene, while his cousin lay
on the floor of the church bleeding and unconscious.</p>

<p>In a moment Nathan had grasped Oliver in a
powerful grip, the signal for a terrible struggle,
during which, however, the latter overpowered
his antagonist; and the would-be murderer escaped
in the darkness, just as Colonel Lindsay, who had
begun to suspect treachery, came hastily upon the
scene followed by Dobson and two or three of the
villagers. The reason of the sudden stoppage of
the bell was apparent to all. With faces of
horror and affright they gazed upon Nathan,
who, breathless and trembling, supported the
wounded man upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it? Who is it?&#8217; demanded Colonel
Lindsay, as he picked up his cloak, which lay in
the porch; but Nathan made no reply; and his
interrogator saw that for some unknown reason he
purposely kept silence; also that he took no notice
of the cloak or the broken lantern, but signed
to Dobson to help him to bear Bertram from the
church.</p>

<p>Colonel Lindsay at once comprehended the man&#339;uvre;
and spreading out the cloak, they laid
Bertram gently down upon it; then Nathan,
assisted by two labourers and the Colonel, raised
him, and preceded by Dobson, whose legs trembled
beneath him, bore their senseless burden through
the churchyard. &#8216;To the Hall!&#8217; was the word
of command, given and obeyed, as they marched
slowly but steadily through the grounds, until
they reached the principal entrance. There a
crowd of bewildered faces including those of
Squire Peregrine, his daughters and servants, met
their gaze.</p>

<p>&#8216;Charles,&#8217; said Colonel Lindsay, &#8216;I bring you
your son. You dare not refuse him a home if he
is living, or a grave if he be dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Squire made no reply, but sank upon the
nearest chair and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shew me to a room,&#8217; continued Colonel
Lindsay.</p>

<p>Now Nathan and the gloomy procession moved
up the broad staircase, leaving those below watching
their progress in dumb amazement. Patricia
was the first to recover, and sign to her father to
follow her to the room they had just left. Her
movement dispersed the crowd of servants to
wonder and talk among themselves; while Gertrude
found herself surrounded by her younger
sisters, who began eagerly plying her with questions.
To all their importunities, Gertrude only
answered: &#8216;Do not ask me&mdash;do not ask me;&#8217; and
with the tears streaming down her face, which
she in vain attempted to control, she mounted
the staircase, and with a trembling hand knocked
at the door of the room into which her brother
had been carried. Colonel Lindsay answered
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I come in?&#8217; she whispered; and receiving
permission, she stepped up to the bed, around
which the men were still busy. One glance at
her apparently dying brother determined her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Colonel Lindsay,&#8217; she said with forced composure,
&#8216;pray telegraph at once for a physician.
Papa cannot collect himself sufficiently; but I am
sure he would wish it.&#8217; Then turning to two
young men who stood waiting near the door, she
despatched them in all speed for the local practitioner,
Dr Downes.</p>

<p>Then she addressed herself to Nathan: &#8216;You
will watch my brother, will you not, until I come
back? If he should return to consciousness, he
will be glad to find you near him.&#8217; Without
waiting for a reply, she left the room quietly,
but soon returned, prepared to act nurse to the
wounded man.</p>

<p>As Nathan raised his eyes, he thought he had
never seen anything so charming before; nothing
of which he had read could exceed the womanly
gentleness and loveliness of that fair face; and his
own flushed with shame as he allowed his eyes
to dwell upon it longer than in his opinion was
consistent with good breeding. &#8216;And at such a
time,&#8217; said Nathan to himself, as he again bent
over the prostrate form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span></p>

<p>Gertrude had brought with her an aged servant
who had nursed them, and still remained an
inmate of the Hall. In spite of the changes produced
by time and the circumstances under which
she now saw him, Nurse Goodall recognised Bertram
at once, and her agitation was extreme; for
being fully acquainted with every circumstance
connected with his flight, she argued that there
could be but one termination to this rash proceeding
on the part of Colonel Lindsay&mdash;the expulsion
of the son now lying at the point of death from his
father's roof; for she knew full well the obstinate
character of the Squire of Linden, and blamed the
Colonel for thus precipitating the end.</p>

<p>As yet, no one in the Hall knew anything
further than that the son of the house had returned
desperately wounded, and that Colonel Lindsay
and Nathan had brought him home: all the rest
was mystery unfathomable. At this juncture, the
surgeon, Dr Downes, entered the room in a little
trepidation, his visits to the Hall being rare, and
this message having been sudden and brief. The
surgeon perceived a complicated case, and made
an examination of his patient. This done, he
inquired if any person was present to whom the
injured man was thoroughly accustomed. Colonel
Lindsay mentioned Nathan and himself. The
surgeon then requested Gertrude and the servants
to retire, and proposed to wait with Nathan the
advent of the physician, who had been telegraphed
for. Colonel Lindsay, promising to introduce Dr
Ferris directly he arrived, left the room also, and
taking Gertrude on his arm, sought the Squire,
who was still in conversation with his eldest
daughter. Patricia and her father received him
coldly, and positively declined to see Bertram.</p>

<p>&#8216;Charles,&#8217; said the Colonel, &#8216;I have much to tell
you, which had better be said privately. Will
you give me a few minutes in your library?&#8217;
The tone was so full of meaning, that the Squire
rose and led the way. The result of their conference
will be shewn in the conclusion of our
narrative.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SALT_MARSHES_OF_BRITTANY" id="THE_SALT_MARSHES_OF_BRITTANY">THE SALT MARSHES OF BRITTANY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> the least interesting part of France is the
wide range of country watered by the Loire. It
is here that feudal and historic remains may best
be studied; fine old castles, palaces, and abbeys
rise before the traveller on all sides. The gloomy
Blois, where those arch enemies of French liberty
the Guises, were assassinated; the castellated den
of Plessis-les-Tours, where Louis XI. carried out
his deep-laid schemes, so well described in <i>Quentin
Durward</i>; and the high towers and deep vaults
of Amboise, which tell of many a tragic conspiracy
and massacre. Here too is the picturesque
Chénonceaux, with its rich ceilings and tapestry,
where Mary Queen of Scots passed some happy
days in her sad life, and Francis I. drew around
him his joyous court. Joan of Arc unfurled her
banner in this interesting province; and the heroic
Vendeans lie buried by thousands, martyrs to
their religion and their king. It is a bright
sunny land; the acacia hedges divide the fields
with their elegant white blossoms; the vineyards
are loaded with purple grapes, the apple orchards
give abundance of cider; a lazy kind of land
where the idler may kill time to his heart's
content. Yet the Loire cannot boast of equal
beauty with the Seine; its raging waters inundate
the country in winter, leaving dry shoals in
summer; and near its mouth, the district called
the Marais is an uninteresting tract of sand, salt
marshes, and ponds. It is of this unpromising
scene that we would write, where ten thousand
persons find occupation in the making of salt.</p>

<p>The interest attaching to the people arises from
their extreme simplicity. Thanks to the salubrity
of the country, they are a fine hardy race, the men
tall and well-proportioned, the women celebrated
for their fresh complexions. Watch them as they
work in the salt-fields carrying heavy loads on their
heads, barefoot, in short petticoats, and running
rather than walking on the edge of the ponds.
But all this is changed on grand fête days, when
the costume of their forefathers in past centuries is
worn. It is called the marriage dress, as it is first
donned by the women on that day. Since it must
last for a lifetime, it is carefully laid aside for
special occasions. There is the embroidered cap
and white handkerchief for the shoulders, edged
with lace; the belt and bodice stitched with
gold thread. A gay violet petticoat is partially
covered by a white dress, the sleeves of which are
either red or white; and an apron of yellow or red
silk adds to the smart attire. The red stockings
are embroidered, and the violet sandals cover well-shaped
feet. As for the bridegroom to this pretty
bride, he adorns himself with a brown cloth shirt,
a muslin collarette, full knickerbockers, and no
less than two waistcoats, one white, the other blue,
with a large black cloth mantle over all. To complete
his toilet there is a three-cornered hat with
velvet cords, white embroidered stockings, and
white buckskin shoes. Such is the costume of
Bourg-de-Batz; but each village has its own distinctive
coiffure. The burning summer sun, whose
rays are reflected from the salt marshes as if from
a lens, forces all to wear wide-brimmed hats for
daily work; the high winds and great changes of
temperature necessitating double or triple woollen
waistcoats; yet even this time-honoured style of
dress has something picturesque about it.</p>

<p>Let us cross to the left bank of the Loire, and
ascend the hill into the little town of Pellerin,
justly proud of its position and commanding views.
From this vantage-ground the eye passes over the
indented coast-line where the points of Mesquer,
Croisic, and many others advance into the sea.
The green pastures and pretty villas of Saint
Etienne form the foreground to the barren reaches
of the salt district, which extends towards Morbihan,
occupying about six thousand acres. The
commercial centre of the country is the town
of Guérande, perched on a hill, and belonging
to a long past age. Its high ramparts, built for
defence in troublous times, can only be entered
by four gates, which bear the marks of portcullises.
Enormous trees entirely conceal it from the traveller,
who would fancy he was approaching a
green forest, instead of an old fortified place belonging
to feudal times. Vines and cereals grow
admirably on the higher ground surrounding it,
to the very verge of the salt marshes, which are
utterly bare. Looking towards the sea, the marks
of its fury are apparent, as if Nature wished to
collect all her weapons of defence for the inhabitants.
Gigantic rocks of capricious forms, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
rising like a bundle of lances; sometimes
lying on the shore, as if they were Egyptian
sphinxes, or lions turned into stone, and polished
by the waves; or even resembling these very
waves petrified in a moment on some tempestuous
day.</p>

<p>Nothing is more easy to describe than a salt
marsh. Imagine a market-garden divided into
squares; but instead of the green vegetables, each
square filled with water, and the walks not level
with, but raised above the spaces about ten inches
in height. The parallelograms are termed in the
vernacular <i>&#339;illets</i>. These are filled with sea-water,
which pours in through conduits at high-tide,
the water having been stored during a period
of from fifteen to thirty days, in reservoirs attached
to each marsh. The system of canals through
which it passes is of a complicated nature; and
the production of the salt constitutes, so to
speak, a special branch of agriculture, where the
visible help of man assists the hidden work of
Nature. The ground must be dug and arranged in
a particular manner, that the saline particles may
crystallise, just as a field where wheat grows and
ripens. Thus, it is not surprising that the salt-workers
adopt the professional terms of the
farmers. At certain times they say &#8216;The marsh
is in flower;&#8217; they speak of the &#8216;harvest&#8217; and
of &#8216;reaping the salt.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is in the <i>&#339;illet</i>, where the water is only about
an inch in depth, that the salt forms, thanks to the
evaporation of the sun, and to the current which,
slowly circulating through the different compartments,
assists the evaporation. The salt which
then falls to the bottom of the basin is raked out
by the <i>paludier</i> into round hollows made at the
edge at certain distances. This is done every one
or two days. The art consists in raking up all
the salt without drawing the mud with it. In
the salt marsh of Guérande they collect separately
a white salt, which forms on the surface under the
appearance of foam, and is used for the salting of
sardines.</p>

<p>It will easily be understood that everything
depends on the sky; above all things, the heat of
the solar rays is necessary. In cloudy weather
there is no crystallisation. Rainy seasons are most
disastrous for the <i>paludiers</i>. The harvest varies
from year to year; but calculating the produce for
ten years, it amounts to three or four thousand
pounds of salt in each <i>&#339;illet</i>. Work begins in the
month of June, and is carried on till October. The
number of <i>&#339;illets</i> varies with the size of the marsh;
that of Guérande contains about twenty-four thousand;
others are much less. The gathered salt is
carried daily to some slope near and packed in a
conical form, very much resembling the tents of a
camp when seen from a distance. At Guérande
the women are seen running in this direction,
carrying the salt on their heads in large wooden
bowls, holding about fifty pounds; whilst at
Bourgneuf the men are employed, who make use
of willow-baskets borne on the shoulder. If the
salt is sold immediately, the cone is only covered
with a little earth. But it more frequently
happens that when the harvest is good, speculators
buy large quantities to keep until the price
rises, and then large masses a thousand pounds
in weight are formed, and protected by a thick
layer of earth.</p>

<p>Like all kinds of property in France, the salt
marshes are much divided. More than three
thousand proprietors share that of Guérande; and
there is a kind of co-operative partnership between
the owner and the worker, the latter generally
receiving a quarter of the profits, out of which he
pays the porters. The gain is, however, miserably
small; and the wonder is how the various families
manage to exist upon it. Even if the wife and
daughter help, the whole family only earn about
two hundred and fifty-five francs a year&mdash;ten
pounds of our money; and in consequence of the
season when the salt is collected, the <i>paludier</i> has
no chance of increasing his income by assisting
the farmers, and can only employ himself in the
trifling labours of winter. So low, indeed, have
the profits sunk, that in some marshes the expenses
have exceeded them; in short there is no kind of
property in France that has for the last century
undergone more terrible reverses than this. These
changes are partly due to the railways, which
have provided a much more efficient and rapid
means of transport for the east of France than
for the west.</p>

<p>There are three large zones in the country
where salt is found. In the eastern district it
is derived from springs and mines; but in the
present day the salt mines are treated like the
springs. Instead of dividing the lumps with the
pickaxe, galleries are cut through and flooded
with water; when this is sufficiently saturated, it
is brought to the surface and evaporated in heated
caldrons. The aid of the sun is not required;
fine or rainy days do not count, and the making of
salt becomes a trade for all the year round. In
the south the plan is varied, because there is no
tide in the Mediterranean Sea. Here, by the help
of a mechanical apparatus, the sea-water is pumped
into enormous squares, where it crystallises, and the
evaporation is accelerated by a continual circulation.
With a warm temperature and a cloudless
sky, the water requires to be renewed only at
intervals, whilst the salt itself is not collected until
the end of summer. Thus the poor workmen of
Brittany have a more laborious and less remunerative
task, though the salt is acknowledged to be
of a finer quality.</p>

<p>The family life is necessarily of a very hard and
parsimonious character. It is impossible to buy
animal food; a thin soup supplies the morning
and evening repast, with poorly cooked potatoes
at mid-day. Those who are near the sea can add
the sardine and common shell-fish, which are not
worth the trouble of taking into the towns to sell.
The cruel proverb, &#8216;Who sleeps, dines,&#8217; finds here
its literal application; during the winter the people
lie in bed all the day to save a meal. There is a
strong family affection apparent among them, the
father exercising a patriarchal authority in the
much-loved home. If they go away, it is never
for more than twenty leagues, to sell the salt from
door to door. Driving before them their indefatigable
mules, borne down at starting with too
heavy a load, they penetrate through the devious
narrow lanes, knowing the path to every hamlet
or farmhouse where they hope to meet with a
customer.</p>

<p>The population of Bourg-de-Batz is said to be a
branch of the Saxon race, and has hitherto been
so jealous of preserving an unbroken genealogy
that marriages are always made among themselves.
A union with a stranger is felt to be a misalliance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
There are some local customs still remaining
which point to an ancient origin, a visible
legacy of paganism perpetuated to the present
day. Such is the festival which is celebrated at
Croisic in the month of August in honour of
Hirmen, a pagan divinity in the form of a
stone with a wide base lying near the sea. Here,
with grotesque movements, the women execute
round the stone a sort of sacred dance, and every
young girl who is unfortunate enough to touch
it is certain not to be married during the year.
There is an old chapel of St Goustan which shews
the tenacity with which the people hold to their
traditions. Once a place for pilgrimages, it has
not been used for sacred purposes during seventy
years, and serves as a magazine for arms. Yet the
inhabitants of Batz visit it yearly, and especially
pray beneath the sacred walls at Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>Sunday is strictly kept as a day of rest from
their toils; then the poorest dress in clean clothes,
men, women, and children going in family groups
to church. After that, relations and neighbours
pay visits. Man is no longer a beast of burden,
but shews that he has a heart and a conscience;
a happy spirit of good temper and frankness
reigns everywhere. Indeed the high moral qualities
of the natives, their love of education, and
strong attachment to their native soil, make them
a vigorous branch of the French nation, and one
calculated to gain the traveller's respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> short pithy criticisms are occasionally as
pointed as those that are more elaborated, may be
gleaned from the following, which we cull at
random for the amusement of our readers.</p>

<p>A little calculation would have saved a well-known
novelist being taken to task by a fair
graduate of Elmira College, who thus relieved her
mind by writing as follows to the College magazine:
&#8216;In a novel of Miss Braddon's, a book of
wonderful plot and incident, the hero, after
coming to grief in a civilised country, went to
Australia to make his fortune; and while yet an
apprentice at the pick and shovel, found an immense
nugget of gold, which he hid, now in one
place, now in another, and finally, was obliged
to carry in his under-shirt pocket for weeks.
When he reached home its sale made him immensely
rich. I had a little curiosity in the
matter, and obtaining the current price of gold,
found, by a simple computation, that the nugget
must have weighed <i>a hundred and ninety-four
pounds</i>. A sizeable pocket that must have been!&#8217;</p>

<p>Albert Smith had his pronouns criticised in the
following neat way by Thackeray. Turning over
the leaves of a young lady's album, Thackeray
came upon the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mont Blanc is the Monarch of Mountains&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="smcap">W. M. Thackeray.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Not quite so good-naturedly did Chorley treat
Patmore's <i>Angel in the House</i>, in his critical versicles:
&#8216;The gentle reader we apprise, That this
new Angel in the House, Contains a tale, not very
wise, About a parson and a spouse. The author,
gentle as a lamb, Has managèd his rhymes to fit;
He haply fancies he has writ Another <i>In Memoriam</i>.
How his intended gathered flowers, And took her
tea, and after sung, Is told in style somewhat like
ours, For delectation of the young.&#8217; Then after
giving &#8216;some little pictures&#8217; in the poet's own
language, the cruel critic went on&mdash;&#8216;From ball to
bed, from field to farm, The tale flows nicely purling
on; With much conceit there is no harm, In
the love-legend here begun. The rest will come
some other day, If public sympathy allows; And
this is all we have to say About the Angel in the
House.&#8217;</p>

<p>This hardly amounted to faint praise, a kind of
encouragement Mr Buckstone owned had a very
depressing effect upon him when he ranked among
youthful aspirants to theatrical honours. &#8216;I
was,&#8217; said the comedian, &#8216;given by my manager a
very good part to act, which being received by the
public with roars of laughter, I considered that
my future was made. A worthy vendor of newspapers,
a great critic and patron of the drama,
asked me for an order. On giving him one, I
called the next day expecting to hear a flattering
account of my performance, but was disappointed.
Determined to learn what effect my acting had
produced on him, I nervously put the question:
&#8220;Did you see me last night?&#8221; to which he replied:
&#8220;O yes.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;were you pleased?&#8221;
And he again replied with his &#8220;O yes.&#8221; I then
came to the point with: &#8220;Did you like my acting?&#8221;
And he rejoined: &#8220;O yes; you made me
<i>smile</i>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>A more appreciative critic was the lady who
after seeing Garrick and Barry severally play
Romeo, observed that in the garden scene,
Garrick's looks were so animated and his gestures
so spirited, that had she been Juliet she
should have thought Romeo was going to jump
up to her; but that Barry was so tender, melting,
and persuasive, that had she been Juliet she
should have jumped down to him.</p>

<p>An old seaman after looking long at the picture
of &#8216;Rochester from the River,&#8217; cried: &#8216;Yes, that's
it&mdash;just opposite old Staunton's, where I served
my time&mdash;just as it used to look when I was a
youngster no higher than my stick. It's forty
years since I saw the old place; but <i>if the haze
would only clear off</i>, I could point out every
house!&#8217;</p>

<p>When M. Gondinet's <i>Free</i> was produced at the
Porte St Martin Theatre, a Parisian critic commended
the playwright for rendering a good deal
of the dialogue inaudible by a liberal employment
of muskets and cannon; and then conjugated <i>Free</i>
thus: &#8216;I am free to go to the play; thou art free
to be bored by the first act; he or she is free to be
bored by act second; we are free to be bored by
the third; you are free to be bored still more by
the fourth and fifth acts; and they are free to stay
away for the future.&#8217;</p>

<p>M. Gondinet's drama was seemingly as fitting a
subject for the pruning-knife as the play of which
Mark Twain, speaking for himself and partner,
deposed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span> &#8216;The more we cut out of it, the better it
got along. We cut out, and cut out, and cut out;
and I do believe this would be one of the best
plays in the world to-day, if our strength had held
out, and we could have gone on and cut out the
rest of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>An Ohio politician &#8216;on the stump,&#8217; stayed the
torrent of his eloquence for a moment, and looking
round with a self-satisfied air, put the question:
&#8216;Now, gentlemen, what do you think?&#8217; A voice
from the crowd replied: &#8216;Well, Mr Speaker, if
you ask me, I think, sir, I do indeed, that if
you and me were to stump the state together,
we could tell more lies than any other two men
in the country, sir; and I'd not say a word
myself, sir, all the time.&#8217; The orator must have
felt as grateful as the actor whose impersonation
of the hero of <i>Escaped from Sing-Sing</i> impelled a
weary pittite to proclaim aloud that the play
would have been better &#8216;if that chap hadn't
escaped from Sing-Sing;&#8217; or the Opera tenor whose
first solo elicited from Pat in the upper regions the
despairing ejaculation: &#8216;Och, my eighteen-pince!&#8217;</p>

<p>A young negro, carefully conducting an old
blind woman through the Philadelphia Exhibition,
stopped in front of a statue of Cupid and Psyche,
and thus enlightened his sightless companion:
&#8216;Dis is a white mammy and her babby, and dey
has just got no clo' onto 'em at all, and he is
a-kissin' of her like mischief, to be shuah. I's
kind o' glad you can't see 'em, 'cause you'd be
flustered like, 'cause dey don't stay in de house
till dey dresses deyselves. All dese figures seem
to be scarce o' clo', but dey is mighty pooty, only
dey be too white to be any 'lation to you and
me, mammy.&#8217; Then turning to a statue in bronze:
&#8216;Dere be one nigger among 'em which is crying
over a handkerchief. Dey call him Othello.
Mebbe his mother is dead, and he can't fetch
her to de show, poor fellow!&#8217;</p>

<p>An American officer riding by the bronze statue
of Henry Clay in Canal Street, New Orleans, was
asked by his Irish orderly if the New Orleans
&#8216;fellers&#8217; were so fond of niggers that they put
a statue of one in their &#8216;fashionablest&#8217; street.
&#8216;That's not a nigger, Tom; that's the great Clay
statue,&#8217; said the amused officer. Tom rode round
the statue, dismounted, climbed upon the pedestal,
examined the figure closely, and then said: &#8216;Did
they tell yez it was clay? It looks to me like
iron!&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom's ignorance was more excusable than that
of the Yankee who, learning on inquiry that the
colossal equestrian figure in Union Square, New
York, was &#8216;General Washington, the father of his
country,&#8217; observed: &#8216;It is? I never heard of
him before; but there is one thing about him
I do like&mdash;he does set a horse plaguy well.&#8217; A
compliment to the artist, at all events.</p>

<p>Perhaps Salvini took it as a compliment when
his Othello was compared to the awakening fury
of the Hyrcanian tiger disturbed at his feast of
blood, and his Hamlet described as &#8216;a magnificent
hoodlum on his muscle, with a big mad on, smashing
things generally;&#8217; and the Boston actress was
delighted to know her &#8216;subtle grace, flexible as
the sinuosities of a morning mist, yet thoroughly
proportioned to the curves of the character, was
most especially noticeable.&#8217; But the Hungarian
prima donna must have felt a little dubious as
to the intentions of the critic who wrote of her:
&#8216;Her voice is wonderful. She runs up and down
the scale with the agility of an experienced cat
running up and down a house-top, and two or
three fences thrown in. She turns figurative flip-flaps
on every bar, tearing up the thermometer to
away above two hundred and twelve, and sliding
down again so far below zero that one feels
chilled to the bone.&#8217; The fair singer would probably
have preferred something in this style:
&#8216;Miss &mdash;&mdash; wore a rich purple suit with a handsome
shade of lavender, a white over-garment,
tight-fitting, with flowing sleeves, and a white
bonnet trimmed with the same shades of purple
and lavender, and she sang finely.&#8217;</p>

<p>That has the merit of being intelligible. The
writer was not in such a desperate condition as
the Memphis theatrical reporter who lauded an
actress as &#8216;intense yet expansive, comprehensive
yet particular, fervid without faultiness; glowing
and still controlled, natural but refined, daring
anything, fearing nothing but to violate grace;
pure as dew, soft as the gush of distant music,
gentle as a star beaming through the riven clouds.
With mystery of charms she comes near to us,
and melts down our admiration into love; but
when we take her to us as something familiar and
delicious, she floats away to the far heights of
fame, and looks down on our despair with countenance
of peaceful lustre and smiles as sweet as
spring.&#8217; If the lady did not reciprocate, her heart
must have been of adamant.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
